# Liskov Substitution Principle

"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."  

Wherever the derived classes are unable to fulfill the functionality of the base class, we are violating the Liskov Principle  
In this case, we usually have to create an additional class that mediates between the classes. Details in the code :)
