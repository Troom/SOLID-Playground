# Dependency Inversion Principle

"Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

High level parts of the system should not depend on low level parts of the system directly, that instead they sould depend on some kind of abstraction.
In other words, you should pass an implementation-free interface to objects, instead of providing a object.
